## Hat tip
Hat tip to Wong2 for the [pick](https://github.com/wong2/pick) library that was used for the curses picker implementation.

## Motivation
I know there are lots of git gui's out there. But I like terminals. Maybe I am oldschool. I was getting by with this bash function for a while:
```
vimgitshow() { git show "$1" | vim - "+set filetype=${1##*.}"; }
```
... but then I decided to slap some code together and browse the history and use vim to open the files.

## Usage
```
usage: viewlog [-h] [-e EDITOR] [-s SKIP] [-l LIMIT] [-f LOGFORMAT] filename

terminal git log broswer

positional arguments:
  filename              Path to filename

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e EDITOR, --editor EDITOR
                        Editor to use
  -s SKIP, --skip SKIP  Starting commit offset
  -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT
                        Total commits to show
  -f LOGFORMAT, --logformat LOGFORMAT
                        Pretty format for git commit
```

## Install
It's really just one python file that you can store in your path. There is a standard install script.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/roubles/viewlog
$ cd viewlog
$ ./install.py
```

## Custom editor
You can use your own editor:
```
$ viewlog <filename> --editor [mvim|gvim]
```
The operating system emacs is not supported, mostly because I can't get it read from stdin.
